## Experiments
In this projects, we fine-tuned BERT model for 4 tasks:
1. SST2 dataset for sentiment analysis on movie review text
2. SQUAD1.1 dataset for question-answering
3. SQUAD2.0 dataset for question-answering
4. GLUE-CoLA dataset for sequence classification task

## Sentiment Analysis 

### Description
This project provides a solution for classifying movie comments as positive or negative using the BERT model. The project includes code references, enhancements, and hyperparameters fine-tuning to improve the model's performance.

### Usage Guide
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required packages listed in the `import necessary libraries` part.
3. Run the codes and check the results. If there is a GPU available in your device, the running speed will be much faster (around half hour).

## BERT on SQuAD 2.0 Dataset

### Description

This project involves **BERT** (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), a state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) model developed by Google in 2018. It has introduced a pre-trained language representation model that captures the contextual understanding of words and sentences.

**SQuAD 2.0** (Stanford Question Answering Dataset 2.0) is a widely used benchmark dataset for question answering (QA) tasks in natural language processing. SQuAD 2.0 is designed to test the ability of QA systems to not only provide accurate answers but also to identify when no answer is available.

This project implements a Question-Answering model based on BERT, trained and tested with SQuAD 2.0 dataset. 

### Usage Guide
#### Files

`main.py` main file to run the training and evluation process.

`modeling_bert.py` defines all structures of BERT model.

`utils_squad.py` some utilization methods for SQuAD dataset preprocessing.

`utils_squad_evaluate.py` evaluation methods for the model.

#### Environment

You need the following packages installed to run the code:

torch

tqdm

argparse

pytorch_transformers

#### Running the code

##### Training

```shell
python main.py --train_file dataset/train.json --predict_file dataset/valid.json --model_type bert --model_name_or_path bert-base-uncased  --output_dir output/ --version_2_with_negative --do_train --do_eval  --do_lower_case --overwrite_output --save_steps 0 --learning_rate 3e-5 --num_train_epochs 2
```

The above command will run the `main.py` to train the model, using `bert-base-uncased` as the pretrained weights, `train.json` as the training set and `valid.json` as validation set. The trainning will be executed with learning rate of **3e-5** for **2** epochs. (Which is the optimal value that we found)

##### Testing

```shell
python main.py --train_file dataset/train.json --predict_file dataset/test.json --model_type bert --model_name_or_path output/  --output_dir output/eval/ --version_2_with_negative --do_eval --do_lower_case
```

The above command will run the `main.py` to evaluate the test set on the model. In the output directory, you can check the output file which contains the answer given by the model to the questions in the test data.
