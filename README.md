## GLUE 

### Description
* Use BertForSequenceClassification pre-trained and pre-modificated model
* Use GLUE-CoLA dataset
For this task, we first want to modify the pre-trained BERT model to give outputs for classification, and then we want to continue training the model on our dataset until that the entire model, end-to-end, is well-suited for our task.

We'll be using BertForSequenceClassification. This is the normal BERT model with an added single linear layer on top for classification that we will use as a sentence classifier. As we feed input data, the entire pre-trained BERT model and the additional untrained classification layer is trained on our specific task.

### Usage Guide
Run the BERT_GLUE.ipynb file on Colab
### Acknowledgment
The pre-trained model is BertForSequenceClassification from Huggingface:

## BERT on SQuAD 1.1 Dataset
### Description
We fine-tuned the improved Bert model for a open-domain QA system based on SQUAD V1.1. According to evaluation, this model achieve 80% of exact, 87% of f1. 
Stanford Question Answering Dataset is a collection of 100k crowdsourced question/answer pairs. In order to compare the model performance, first we use squad v1.1 as training dataset.

### Usage Guide
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required packages .
3. Run the codes in Train_model_GPU_BERT_SQUAD1.1.ipynb.

## BERT on SQuAD 2.0 Dataset

### Description

This project involves **BERT** (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), a state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) model developed by Google in 2018. It has introduced a pre-trained language representation model that captures the contextual understanding of words and sentences.

**SQuAD 2.0** (Stanford Question Answering Dataset 2.0) is a widely used benchmark dataset for question answering (QA) tasks in natural language processing. SQuAD 2.0 is designed to test the ability of QA systems to not only provide accurate answers but also to identify when no answer is available.

This project implements a Question-Answering model based on BERT, trained and tested with SQuAD 2.0 dataset. 

### Usage Guide
#### Files

`main.py` main file to run the training and evluation process.

`modeling_bert.py` defines all structures of BERT model.

`utils_squad.py` some utilization methods for SQuAD dataset preprocessing.

`utils_squad_evaluate.py` evaluation methods for the model.

#### Environment

You need the following packages installed to run the code:

torch

tqdm

argparse

pytorch_transformers

#### Running the code

##### Training

```shell
python main.py --train_file dataset/train.json --predict_file dataset/valid.json --model_type bert --model_name_or_path bert-base-uncased  --output_dir output/ --version_2_with_negative --do_train --do_eval  --do_lower_case --overwrite_output --save_steps 0 --learning_rate 3e-5 --num_train_epochs 2
```

The above command will run the `main.py` to train the model, using `bert-base-uncased` as the pretrained weights, `train.json` as the training set and `valid.json` as validation set. The trainning will be executed with learning rate of **3e-5** for **2** epochs. (Which is the optimal value that we found)

##### Testing

```shell
python main.py --train_file dataset/train.json --predict_file dataset/test.json --model_type bert --model_name_or_path output/  --output_dir output/eval/ --version_2_with_negative --do_eval --do_lower_case
```

The above command will run the `main.py` to evaluate the test set on the model. In the output directory, you can check the output file which contains the answer given by the model to the questions in the test data.

The codes are based on BERT QA model provided by Huggingface: https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/main/examples/pytorch/question-answering


## Sentiment Analysis 

### Description
This project provides a solution for classifying movie comments as positive or negative using the BERT model. The project includes code references, enhancements, and hyperparameters fine-tuning to improve the model's performance.

### Usage Guide
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required packages listed in the `import necessary libraries` part.
3. Run the codes and check the results. If there is a GPU available in your device, the running speed will be much faster (around half hour).
